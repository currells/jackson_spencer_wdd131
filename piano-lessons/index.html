I am experienced in giving piano lessons before and I am great with kids. The lessons will take place in my home and I won't be able to drive to give a lesson.</p>

            <p>These lessons are designed for either beginner or intermediate students. My main purpose in giving piano lessons is to be able to have the opportunity to inspire people who are just beginning. Piano can be very frustrating at first, and I want to be able to help kids get over that first stepso that they can continue to improve whenever I'm done teaching them.</h2>
