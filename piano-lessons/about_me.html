            <p>My name is Jackson Spencer and I am a computer science Major at BYU-Idaho. I used to go to school for Piano Performance, but decided to pursue music as a hobby. I have been playing the piano since I was young and eventually I was enrolled in piano lessons when I was 8.</p>
            <p>Piano is a passion of mine and I enjoy playing for others and teaching others how to play. I believe the piano is a gift that will only grow with the right people teaching piano lessons to the next generation. I want to be the reason that someone becomes inspired to play more, or at least give every child the opportunity to enjoy playing the piano.</p>

            Music in general has always been a passion to me, and I enjoy sharing my talents with others. If there is a campfire and a guitar I'll try to play around as you can see in the picture.
