    <h2>Jackson Spencer</h2>
    <p>What's up my name is Jackson. I'm in Northern California which is my home town. </p>
    <p>I'm a junior and I'm living at my parents house and working at The Habit Burger Grill.</p>
    <p> I used to be a Piano Performance Major, but I decided to switch to Computer Science. I like to problem solve and I think it will be great for my future.</p>
    <p>I'm excited for this class and thank you for reading my webpage.</p>
